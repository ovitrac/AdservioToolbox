Explain the rationale behind a toolbox concept, invariant, or design decision.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Instructions:
1. Parse the argument as a topic keyword (e.g., "eco", "cloak", "memctl", "sovereignty", "precedence", "fts", "hooks").
2. Search the following documentation files for relevant sections:
   - `docs/cheat/L1.md`, `docs/cheat/L2.md`, `docs/cheat/L3.md`
   - `docs/tldr/*.md`
   - `docs/workflows/first-session.md`
   - `CLAUDE.md` (project instructions)
   - `README.md`
3. Construct a structured answer with:
   - **What**: one-sentence definition
   - **Why**: the rationale — what problem it solves, what risk it mitigates
   - **Invariants**: rules that must always hold
   - **Trade-offs**: what you give up, what you gain
4. Cite the source file(s) where the information was found.
5. If the topic is not found, suggest related topics from the documentation.
